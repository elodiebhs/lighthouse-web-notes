# elodie's Notes


In markdown the # symbol denotes a header, similar to header tags in HTML. Also like header tags, you can make the header smaller or bigger.
# This is an H1 header (largest)
###### This is an H6 header (smallest)

## Summary 

This repository contains all of the notes taken by [elodie](https://github.com/elodiebhs) for the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp.

### Table of content
* [Week 1](/Week_1)
  * [Day 1](/Week_1/Day_1)

  in the above markdown, we are creating an unordered, bulleted list with the * character. This is similar to using the ul HTML tag. You may have noticed that the Day 1 list item is indented. This creates a sub-item in the list (which sometimes results in a different style of bullet for that item).

  Markdown lists can also be ordered by preceding each item with a number like so:

  1. Item One 
  2. Item Two
  3. Item Three
